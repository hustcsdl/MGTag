The code is associated with the paper: 
Reachability Queries in Very Large Graphs: A Fast Refined Online Search Approach (under review)

Detailed usage is explained below, here we give sample usage
for the main methods of the papers above.  
---------------------------------------------------------------
Feline  : ./feline sample.gra -test sample.test
Feline-B: ./feline sample.gra -test sample.test -inv
---------------------------------------------------------------

This package is provided for the repeatability purposes. It may
contain some (experimental )sections that is not mentioned in 
the paper. PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
to run the program flawlessly. Feel free to use it for
research purposes.
  
The code is written in c++ and built on the codebase
of the paper:
Hilmi Yildirim, Vineet Chaoji and Mohammad J. Zaki : "GRAIL: Scalable Reachability Index for Large Graphs", Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 3(1):276-284. 2010. 

It uses thesame graph format.

To compile :
make

To run :
./feline -h

INPUT GRAPH FORMAT: (see sample.gra)
 Notes : Second line gives the number of nodes n. The node ids should be in [0,n-1]. 

TEST FILE FORMAT: (see sample.test)
 - Each line contains triples (<source> <target> <reachability>)
 The program compares its output with <reachability> value of each query and prints a success ratio which is supposed to be 1.
 However if you dont know the ground truth, (i.e. for very large graphs) 
     you can give any value for <reachability> and ignore the success ratio.


The GRAPH needs to bo already a DAG !!!
We do not provide any implementation of Tarjan's algorithm in our codes.

For Feline-B algorithm, use "-inv" option.

Sample usage:
./feline input.gra -test test.txt (for Feline)
./feline input.gra -test test.txt -inv (for Feline-B)
